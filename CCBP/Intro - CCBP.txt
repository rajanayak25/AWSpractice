Software -> Software is a set of instructions to hardware
             - Its easily changeable
             - have functionality
             - it has versions

Hardware -> Physical Componet Ex: Keyboard,Mouse,CPU etc.
           - When electricity passed to it, it will accessible to S/W


Operating System -> Its a main S/W which makes other softwares to work with the H/W
                 -> Interface b/w H/W and S/W

                 Different O.S:
                 Computer: Windows 10, ubuntu,Mac OSX
                 Mobile: android 11, ios13


Internet: -> Computer network that interconnects billions of computer devices through out the world

  Ex: Sender -> Sending message -> How are you? -> Divide as packets and transmiting through a N/w -> 1.How 2.are 3.you? -> Reasseble at Reciever Computer -> Message Recieved by Reciever

  Router -> Connecting device b/w 2 N/w's

  Route -> Its a path for transmission the packets

Application:

-> Application is a S/W which is developed for specific purpose 

Ex: Google Chrome(Surfing internet), WhatsApp(Communication)

Front end: 

-> Everything which we can view is a part of front end Ex: Icons, Images,texts,Buttons etc.

Parsing:

-> Understanding and Seperating content Ex: Seperating header page and other content from a webpage

Rendering:

Markup: 

Highlighting the views (texts/paragraphs) Ex: Company name

CSS:

Customization of styles like Font, Color, Shapes, Positioing etc.

javascript: 

-> It can change the website contents dynamically with out reloading entire site

Getting required content what we requests only instead of whole information(entire site)  Ex: if we request cart details it will show only cart related information

Mobile Apps:

 Android: Java, Kotlin IOS: Swift, Objective-C

Responsive Web Design:

 Designing a website which fit for All type of screensizes Ex: Website should fit in For Mobile phones (compatible to 7inch display) &For Laptop 16 inch display 

Cross Platform: 

-> Platfroms which are used for Developing Apps in multiple Environments like Android and IoS
-> It will Reduce the time for Developers

Ex: React Native - Developed by Facebook   (using by Tesla,Skype, Facebook)
    Flutter - Developed by Google  (using by ebay, Alibaba Group) 


Backend:

Server + Database - retrieving data stored & processing data 

Data:

-> In Backend, Data is any information that has to be stored

- JS

To Manage Databases:

- My SQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Mongo DB
- Maria DB
- Dynamo DB
- redis
- Cassandra
- elastic

User Interface:

 User interacting with softwares through UI

Application programming interface(API):

 Applications interact with each other through API's

Cloud:

-> Servers that are accessed over internet
-> The Softwares that run on those servers

Cloud providers take care of:

- Security
- Maintenance
- Purchasing H/W
- Power and Internet connection
